# bash-git-branch
Show Git Branch in your bash prompt.

I really love seeing my Git Branch in my Fish prompt and thought my bash-using buddies might appreciate the same. The code utterly stolen from here: https://coderwall.com/p/fasnya/add-git-branch-name-to-bash-prompt - check that out for a better explanation etc, I have put in a repo for ease of sharing.

To use either copy and paste contents of showGitBranch.sh into your .bashrc (Found in your home folder) or if you're feeling particularly flashy, source the script instead.

~~~~
# your bashrc

source "path/to/showGitBranch.sh"

# all your other bash things.....
